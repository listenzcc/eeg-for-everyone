        A brain–computer interface (BCI), sometimes called a brain–machine interface (BMI) or smartbrain, is a direct
        communication pathway between the brain's electrical activity and an external device, most commonly a computer
        or robotic limb. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human
        cognitive or sensory-motor functions.[1] They are often conceptualized as a human–machine interface that skips
        the intermediary component of the physical movement of body parts, although they also raise the possibility of
        the erasure of the discreteness of brain and machine. Implementations of BCIs range from non-invasive (EEG, MEG,
        MRI) and partially invasive (ECoG and endovascular) to invasive (microelectrode array), based on how close
        electrodes get to brain tissue.[2]
