        Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is a scientific method for studying the timing of vision. In RSVP, a
        sequence of stimuli are shown to an observer at one location in their visual field. The observer is instructed
        to report one of these stimuli - the target - which has a feature that differentiates it from the rest of the
        stream. For instance, observers may see a sequence of stimuli consisting of grey letters with the exception of
        one red letter. They are told to report the red letter. People make errors in this task in the form of reports
        of stimuli that occurred before or after the target. The position in time of the letter they report, relative to
        the target, is an estimate of the timing of visual selection on that trial.

        The term, and methodologies to study it, was first introduced by Mary C. Potter.[1]
